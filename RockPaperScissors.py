Description:
    A game of rock-paper-scissors. Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock. At the start a menu is provided with the options to play, quit,
or check score. The user can choose between single-player against the computer or two-player against another user. Users choose their weapon (Rock, Paper,
or Scissors). If single-player, computer chooses at random. The winner is then declared and scores/total-games count is updated. The menu reappears with
options to play again, quit, or check score. Enjoy!
Log:
10/20/2021 Version 1.0 - Created program
10/21/2021 Version 2.0 - Sophisticated menu, added 2-player option
10/26/2021 Version 2.1 - Added emoji decorations, fixed tie not adding to games_played bug, reformatted comments, added .lower comforts for user
10/28/2021 Version 2.2 - Added emoji1/emoji2 variables in choice announcements
11/02/2021 Version 2.3 - Added sound to weapon selection using playsound()
11/02/2021 Version 2.4 - Added winsound.SND_ASYNC to allow sound to play in background so that it does not interrupt/delay the program
Bugs:
Features:
    - Two-player optional
    - Score and games played are counted
    - Quit option
    - User can switch between 1 and 2 player without having to restart the program, score will not be messed up
    - Emojis for visual effect
    - Not picky about capitalization in inputs
    - Plays sound prompting user to choose weapon
